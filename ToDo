CURRENT STATUS:  1.  I understand the header of the file format.  (4 hours' work)

To Do:

1:  Figure out how to read a .bmp file
		-Look up specification
		-Try making minor or obvious changes to see if I understand

2:  Figure out what files need to be edited to reflect the new map
		-This might help: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/map-guide-v2-0.719527/
		-AFAIK it isn't just the maps.  There's also a list of positions (i.e., of cities and ports).
		
3:  Try to convert the map (Miller:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cylindrical_projection).
		-Trying a regular Mercator might be best at first, though other cylindrical may work
		-Probably needs to be re-scaled to fit the original pixel size
		-I imagine a lot of work needs to be done here with edge cases, collisions, etc.
		-If this doesn't work for all maps, might try doing it with terrain and heightmap
			and then generating others with GIMP or something.
			
4:  Try to account for the Americas being in the wrong latitude.
		-Will a shift, re-map, un-shift work?
		-They seem to be about 11-12 degrees too far north:  http://i.imgur.com/Lr80324.jpg
		-Greenland should not be moved (unless moving it doesn't cause problems.
		
5:  Extras:
		-It would be nice to have my maps overlaid on others to see how good it looks
			(like these: https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/2jjuue/if_the_eu4_map_was_more_geographically_correct/clcfa8n/)
		-Small, manual edits to make things look nicer are likely to be needed.  Hopefully not many.
		
6:  Figure out the process for putting mods on Steam Workshop
