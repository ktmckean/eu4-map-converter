4/4/2018:  Project is unfinished and on indefinite hiatus.  My interests have moved on and I don't do much with EU4 these days.

This is a tool for generating new map projections for use in the game Europa Universalis 4.
Everything here (except the maps folder) was written by Kerry McKean.

The goal is to produce a piece of software that:
	-Takes the map files that come with the game,
	-Converts each file's data into a different map projection
	-Writes them out to new files in a format that will be usable as a mod without further steps.
	
Files:
-ToDo.txt:  This contains a steo-by-step breakdown of the tasks I expect I'll have to do.
	It will be updated as I go along with greater detail.
	
map/:  This is the map folder from the game.  Right now, I have it here to make the files
	easier for me to work with.  However, they will be removed once I have a proper path-querying
	program in place.  I do not own these files, and while the Paradox Development Studios mod
	rules allow me to have them here for this purpose, I'd just as soon take them down.
